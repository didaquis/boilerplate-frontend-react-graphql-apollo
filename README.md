# ‚ö°Ô∏è Boilerplate: Frontend with React + GraphQL + Apollo

This project is an easy and fast way to start new projects in JavaScript. 
The main goal is to provide two repositories: one for the backend and one for the frontend application. 

This repository is for the frontend and is designed to work with another boilerplate: [the backend](https://github.com/didaquis/boilerplate-backend-node-graphql-mongodb)

If you prefer it, you can use one of these boilerplates without using the other! Feel free to explore any ideas like developing your own backend in PHP or your frontend in Angular, for example.


### üéÅ What is included on the frontend boilerplate?
Technologies used are: React + GraphQL + Apollo Client + Bootstrap 4

**‚ú® These are some of the highlights:** 

‚úÖ A frontend application ready to use!  
‚úÖ Users can login and registrate  
‚úÖ Separated routes for users with the role of the 'administrator'  
‚úÖ Ready to connect with backend  
‚úÖ If you don't like Bootstrap, it's easy to implement any other one UI library or use your own CSS  

### üìù Frontend Requirements
* Backend must be running. I recommend use my [backend boilerplate](https://github.com/didaquis/boilerplate-backend-node-graphql-mongodb)
* Node.js 16 or higher

### üìö How to run the application?
* Use the command: `npm install`.
* Configure the application:
  * Duplicate the configuration file `_env` and rename it as `.env`
  * Edit the file `.env`
* Then use: `npm run start`. 

### üöÄ How to deploy?
* Use the command: `npm install --production`.
* Make sure you have the correct environment vars configuration on the `.env` file.
* Then use `npm run build` to create a production bundle. This bundle will be created in the `./build` folder.
* The content of `./build` folder is ready to be deployed to production.

**Do you need help with `.env` file?** 

Don't worry, here you have a guide:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| REACT_APP_PROTOCOL | Protocol to communicate with backend. Set http or https |
| REACT_APP_HOST | Host of backend. An IP or domain |
| REACT_APP_PORT | Port of backend |
| REACT_APP_GRAPHQL | Endpoint of GraphQL API |

### üíª Tricks for development
* Run app in dev mode: `npm run start`
* Run the linter: `npm run lint`
